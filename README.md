# Whatsapp-Bot
I created a whatsapp bot in which u can send msges at a specific time to a person. U can contribute more and more to it..

make sure u have given libraries installed:

1. pywhatkit
2. sys

sys is a preinstalled library. But checking if its installed is always good.

make sure to include country code when u type the number.

also make sure to stay logged in into ur whatsapp web account.
